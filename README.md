# HINITE_ecml2023
First, you need to install the TensorFlow 2.4 (or above).

Next, you need to decompress the dataset in the "data" folder.

Then, you can train the HINITE by runing main.py. 
For example, CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1 python main.py

Finally, you just open the "Evaluate_for_HINITE.ipynb", and run every cell to evaluate the HINITE. 

We give an example of training and evaluating the HINITE on the Youtube dataset.
